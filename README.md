# colorTheme.vim

A colorTheme selector that works like the vscode colortheme command
build for [Base16 Vim](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-vim) so you can easily toggle between those colortheme.

## Useage

```shell
Plug 'Gaochengzhi/vimColorSelector'
```
In vim:
```shell
:Colortheme<cr>
```
## TODO

I haven't find an elegant way to save the selected colorscheme option to the config file. So currently this plug only servers as a display unit.
If you have any idea, please commit.
